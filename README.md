### Workflow/job management, Data integration, ETL, web scrapping, orchestration

For workflows, it is important how the following concepts are implemented:
* Workflow task: what can be executed and how we specify the tasks to be executed (programmatically, declaratively etc.)
* Dependencies: when and how tasks are started. It is not only about simple conditions like whether a (previous) task has been finished and with which status. Conditions might be much more complex and be essentially separate tasks.
  * How to define conditional execution where execution of a task depends on dynamic conditions
  * Choosing a task to be executed dynamically, that is, task to be executed is not known at the time of graph definition
* Triggering workflows: How a whole workflow execution can be started (from inside or outside). These functions make workflow managers similar to asynchronous systems:
  * From external systems, for example, by listening to some protocol
  * Synchronous execution, for example, using schedulers like once per day

A conventional workflow management system deals with task arguments and task return values. The goal here is to make the whole workflow with all its tasks data-aware, for example, by sharing some data. For the point of view of data processing, there is an additional aspect:
* If it is a graph of data processing, then the question is where and how the system takes the data properties into account:
  * Data state and data ranges like only data for the last month
  * Data structure like columns and tables, for example, only these tables
* Such data-aware workflows are most important for data-driven business, and the question is what they know about the data and how this knowledge is used to manage and execute workflow.

General purpose workflow management systems:
* (21.6k) https://github.com/apache/airflow https://airflow.apache.org A platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. "Airflow is based on DAG representation and doesnâ€™t have a concept of input or output, just of flow."
  * Tasks (Operators). Pluggable Python classes with many conventional execution types provided like `PythonOperator` or `BashOperator`. Note that these are task types which require custom task code for parameterization and instantiation. For `PythonOperator`, the custom code is provided as a Python function: `python_callable=my_task_fn`. Function arguments are passed in another parameter `op_kwargs`.
    * https://marclamberti.com/blog/airflow-pythonoperator/
  * Data. Small data sharing between tasks is performed via XCOM (cross-communication messages).
    * https://marclamberti.com/blog/airflow-xcom/
  * Dependencies. It is done programmatically and statically, for example: `my_task_1 >> my_task_2 >> [my_task_3, my_task_4]`
  * Scheduling. It is possible to specify `start_date` and `schedule_interval` (using CRON expression or `timedelta` object).

  * Dependencies. "Luigi doesnâ€™t use DAGs. Instead, Luigi refers to "tasks" and "targets." Targets are both the results of a task and the input for the next task." "Luigi has 3 steps to construct a pipeline: `requires()` defines the dependencies between the tasks, `output()` defines the the target of the task, `run()` defines the computation performed by each task"
  * Scheduling. "Luigi ... has a central scheduler *and* custom calendar schedule capabilities, providing users with lots of flexibility" (in contrast to Airflow).

## Asynchronous data processing

### What is asynchronous data processing

TBD

### Reactive programming

Approaches to asynchronous programming:

* Callback model:
  * A callback function is provided as part of an asynchronous call
  * The call is non-blocking and the source program continues execution
  * It is not possible to await for the return (it is essentially done by the callback function)
  * The callback function can be viewed as a one-time listener for a return event, that is, it represents code which consumes the result
  * The source code where the call is made and the consumer of the result are in different functions and cannot share (local) context
  * The callback function may make its own asynchronous calls which leads to a "callback hell"

* Future/promise:
  * An asynchronous call is made as usual but return a special wrapper object
  * A callback function is not specified and is not used
  * The returned result is consumed by the code which follows the call (as opposed to its use in a separate callback function)
  * The future/promise is supposed to be awaited. Awaiting denotes a point where we say that the next instruction needs the result
  * The awaiting point is like a one-time single-value listener for the result where the program execution is suspended until the return event is received

Resources:
* The Reactive Manifesto: https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/
* Reactive Design Patterns: https://www.reactivedesignpatterns.com/
* Reactive programming in Python
* Reactive programming in Java
* Reactive programming in C#

### Reactive streaming

* Listeners:
  * A callback function is registered and then automatically called for each incoming event
  * Callback functions are (normally) called only sequentially, that is, next event can be processed only when the previous event has been processed by the previous callback invocation. Callbacks are not executed concurrently.
  * The result of a callback invocation is frequently needed because it is executed by the event producer

* Reactive streams:
  * It is a graph of producers and consumers
  * Consumers and producers are not supposed to communicate in a free manner by sending messages to each other where a sender knows the address(s) of the receivers
  * An element declares which messages it produces but it is unaware of who will subscribe to and consume its messages, and how they will be used (in contrast to the actor model)
  * An element must know what kind of messages it needs and explicitly subscribe to specific producers - messages will not come automatically just because somebody wants to send them to us
  * For data processing, reative streams provide a number of operators which can be applied to an input stream(s) and produce an output stream
  * Resources:
    * https://www.reactive-streams.org/
    * (3.2k) https://github.com/reactor/reactor
    * http://reactivex.io/ An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams:
      * (44.2k) https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava Reactive Extensions for the JVM â€“ a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM
      * (3.8k) https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY Reactive Extensions for Python
      * etc. https://github.com/ReactiveX

* Actor model:
  * Each element has an identifier (address, reference) which is used by other actors to send messages
  * A sender (producer) must know what it wants to do when it sends messages and it must know its destination
  * Receiving elements can receive messages from any other element and their task is to respond according to their logic (as expected by the sender)
  * Actors receive messages without subscribing to any producer (as opposed to the actor model where you will not receive anything until you subscribe to some event producer)
  * Each actor has a handler (callback) which is invoked for processing incoming messages
  * Actors are supposed to have a state and frequently it is why we want to define different actors
  * Resources:
    * (11.4k) https://github.com/akka/akka Build highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM
    * (11.8k) https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM

    * https://gitlab.com/python-actorio/actorio Actorio - a simple actor framework for asyncio

### Event loops vs. threads

* Both a thread task and an event loop task are executed until finished, that is, the code to execute is provided as a procedure
* Thread tasks are dispatched by the system (not application) while dispatching logic of event tasks is part of the application
* At each moment, there is a fixed number of threads concurrently executed by one process. The number of concurrently executed event loop tasks is not limited.
* Thread tasks are (automatically) switched at the instruction level and the dispatcher is unaware of the needs of this thread or the application. Event loop tasks are switched at the level of logical application units depending on what this application needs.
* In a multi-thread application, we need to manage the threads ourselves, e.g., by creating and deleting them. In an event loop application, the tasks (starting, suspending, finishing) is managed by the event loop manager.
* In an event loop application, tasks specify dependencies on other tasks, and these points are used while dispatching the execution of tasks. Threads cannot declare dependencies on the results provided by other tasks. If we need some external result, then the thread has to wait. This logic has to be implemented manually and the system dispatcher is unaware of these dependencies.
